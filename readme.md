# Data structures and Algorithms

## Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a powerful programming technique that combines the correctness of brute force and the efficiency of greedy algorithms.

The most common use-cases for dynamic programming are problems that aims to:

1. Find an optimal solution.
2. Count the total number of solutions for a problem.

The method was invented by Richard Bellman in 1950s.

DP is about solving and identifying all the subproblems of a big problem, memoizing them, and later use this memoized solved problems to improve the efficiency of the algorithm.

In general, we can say that

$$PD = Recursion + Memoization$$
